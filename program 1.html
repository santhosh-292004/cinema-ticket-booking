    TIRUPUR: Struggling amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a theatre group in Tirupur has decided to open up its movie halls for private screenings in which people can book the theatre for just Rs 3,999 per show. 
</p>
<p>
    Despite the release of new movies, there hasn’t been a huge crowd even in the festive season. In a bid to increase the footfall, we came up with this concept to celebrate occasions and special events inside the theatres with private screenings for 25 people at the cost Rs 3,999 per movie,” he said.

Every extra person will be charged Rs 120 and guests will have to leave a seat vacant between them. “The occasion could be birthday parties, family and friends’ get-together etc. They can celebrate the occasion in the hall and even cut cake.
